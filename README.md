# Monzo Pairing Test for iOS Engineers

Thank you for taking the time to interview with us! We're excited to spend some time working through this project together.

## Headlines.app

This repo contains a small iOS project built using Swift 5.9.2 on Xcode 15.1. It's currently built using UIKit and MVC. It fetches articles from The Guardian API and displays them in a table.

## Before the session

Feel free to spend as long as you like reading the code, but please don't commit or make any changes - we'd like to start the pairing excercise from the default project state.

Please make sure you can get it running in a recent version of Xcode. We will ask you to screen share using Google Meet during the call, so please make sure those system permissions are set up ahead of time.

At the start of the pairing session, we will detail a couple of tasks for us to work together on. One is a small UI update, and the other is related to formatting and sorting dates.

> [!Note]
> If articles fail to load you might need to replace the Guardian API key. Please go [here](https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer) and register as a developer to obtain a key.

## What we're looking for

1. A fluency with the language and tooling
2. The ability to make well-reasoned trade-offs
3. The ability to communicate clearly with the interviewer

**This is not a memory test.** We do not expect you to recall every `DateFormatter` or `UITableView` API; looking those things up on the web, reading docs or asking the interviewer is totally acceptable. It's also a *pairing* excercise, so we will throw you reminders/suggestions if appropriate.

It's also not a speed test. This short interview is not enough time to get both tasks done to a high standard.

### What a great interview looks like

A great interview would be accomplishing at least one of the set tasks and leaving the codebase in a better place for the next (imaginary!) engineer. Throughout, there would be open and fluid communication that explores the pros and cons of each major decision we make.

Best of luck and thanks again for taking the time to interview with us.
